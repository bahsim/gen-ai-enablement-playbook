# Integration Patterns Logic

## Logic Name: External Service Integration Architecture Patterns

**Purpose**: Defines the patterns for integrating with external services, including payment gateways, analytics services, and third-party APIs.

**Context**: Applied throughout the checkout system to ensure consistent and secure integration with external services.

**Inputs**:
- `serviceRequirements`: External service needs
- `securityRequirements`: Security constraints
- `performanceRequirements`: Performance constraints
- `reliabilityRequirements`: Reliability needs

**Logic Flow**:
- Determines integration strategy
- Implements service communication
- Handles authentication and authorization
- Manages error handling and retries
- Coordinates service responses

**Outputs**:
- `integrationArchitecture`: Integration structure
- `communicationPatterns`: Service communication patterns
- `authenticationPatterns`: Authentication patterns
- `errorHandlingPatterns`: Error handling patterns

**Dependencies**:
- External APIs: Third-party services
- Authentication Services: Service authentication
- Error Handling Services: Error management
- Monitoring Services: Service monitoring

**Dependents**:
- All external integrations use these patterns
- Service responses affect application behavior
- Error handling affects user experience
- Monitoring affects system reliability

**Business Rules**:
- Integrations must be secure and reliable
- Service communication must be efficient
- Error handling must be comprehensive
- Monitoring must be comprehensive

**Edge Cases**:
- Service unavailability
- Authentication failures
- Network timeouts
- Service response errors
- Rate limiting

**Error Conditions**:
- `ServiceUnavailableError`: External service unavailable
- `AuthenticationError`: Service authentication failure
- `NetworkError`: Network communication failure
- `RateLimitError`: Service rate limiting
- `ResponseError`: Invalid service response

**Performance Impact**:
- Optimized service calls
- Efficient error handling
- Cached service responses
- Background service monitoring

**Security Considerations**:
- Secure service authentication
- Protected service communication
- Safe error handling
- Secure service data handling

**Testing Scenarios**:
- Service integration tests
- Authentication tests
- Error handling tests
- Performance tests
- Security tests

**Maintenance Notes**:
- Integration pattern updates
- Security updates for integrations
- Performance monitoring for services
- Service reliability improvements

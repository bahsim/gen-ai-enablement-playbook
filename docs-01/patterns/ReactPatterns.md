# React Patterns Logic

## Logic Name: React Component Architecture Patterns

**Purpose**: Defines the architectural patterns used for React components in the checkout system, including component composition, state management, and lifecycle patterns.

**Context**: Applied across all React components in the checkout system to ensure consistent architecture and maintainable code.

**Inputs**:
- `componentRequirements`: Functional requirements for components
- `stateRequirements`: State management needs
- `lifecycleRequirements`: Component lifecycle needs
- `integrationRequirements`: External service integration needs

**Logic Flow**:
- Determines appropriate component type (Class vs Functional)
- Selects state management pattern
- Defines component composition strategy
- Implements lifecycle management
- Handles external integrations

**Outputs**:
- `componentArchitecture`: Component structure and patterns
- `stateManagement`: State handling patterns
- `lifecycleManagement`: Component lifecycle patterns
- `integrationPatterns`: External service integration patterns

**Dependencies**:
- React: Core React framework
- Redux: State management
- Context API: Component communication
- Hooks: Functional component patterns

**Dependents**:
- All React components follow these patterns
- State management depends on patterns
- Component testing uses patterns
- Documentation references patterns

**Business Rules**:
- Components must follow established patterns
- State management must be consistent
- Lifecycle management must be predictable
- Integration patterns must be secure

**Edge Cases**:
- Component unmounting during async operations
- State updates after component unmount
- Memory leaks from event listeners
- Race conditions in async operations

**Error Conditions**:
- `ComponentError`: Component rendering failure
- `StateError`: State management failure
- `LifecycleError`: Lifecycle management failure
- `IntegrationError`: External service integration failure

**Performance Impact**:
- Optimized component rendering
- Efficient state management
- Proper lifecycle cleanup
- Optimized external integrations

**Security Considerations**:
- Secure component communication
- Protected state management
- Safe external integrations
- Input validation in components

**Testing Scenarios**:
- Component rendering tests
- State management tests
- Lifecycle tests
- Integration tests
- Error handling tests

**Maintenance Notes**:
- Pattern updates require component updates
- State management pattern changes
- Lifecycle pattern improvements
- Integration pattern security updates

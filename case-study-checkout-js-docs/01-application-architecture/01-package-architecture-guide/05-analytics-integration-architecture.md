# Analytics Integration Architecture

This document describes the patterns for integrating analytics and performance monitoring into the checkout application.

## 1. Event Tracking

The primary mechanism for analytics is **Event Tracking**. The system is designed to monitor key user interactions and report them to an analytics service.

*   **Pattern:** An event-driven architecture where specific user actions (e.g., applying a coupon, selecting a shipping method) trigger events. These events are then processed by a dedicated service that formats and forwards the data to an external analytics provider.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **`AnalyticsTracker`:** A service responsible for handling the events.
    *   **`EventLogger`:** A utility for dispatching events from various points in the application.

## 2. Performance Metrics

The system tracks key performance indicators to monitor the user experience.

*   **Load Time Tracking:** Measures the time it takes for the main application and critical checkout steps to become interactive.
*   **Conversion Tracking:** Monitors the entire checkout funnel, from initial load to successful order confirmation, to identify drop-off points.

## 3. Error Logging

All significant application errors are captured and logged to an external service for analysis.

*   **Pattern:** The central `<ErrorBoundary>` and `ErrorLogger` service catch both rendering and asynchronous errors.
*   **Integration:** These services integrate with an external logging provider to collect, aggregate, and analyze error events, allowing the team to proactively identify and fix bugs.

# Spec: The Definitive Architectural Overview for `checkout-js`

## 1. Objective

To analyze the `C:\learn\checkout-js` project and generate the complete content for the **`00-overview/01-architectural-overview.md`** document.

## 2. Rationale

This document is the **"Level 1" entry point** to the project's entire "Living System of Knowledge." It provides the essential high-level context—the "map of the forest"—required for a developer to understand the system's purpose, its key architectural pillars, and how to navigate the deeper "Level 2" documentation. A clear and comprehensive overview is the primary prerequisite for both efficient human onboarding and high-quality AI-assisted development.

## 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the `00-overview/01-architectural-overview.md` file being populated with the following sections:

1.  **High-Level Summary:**
    *   A concise paragraph describing the project's primary purpose.
2.  **Core Technologies & Dependencies:**
    *   A list of the key technologies used in the project, with a brief explanation of each one's role.
    *   *Must include:* React, TypeScript, SCSS, BigCommerce Checkout SDK, Formik, and Jest.
3.  **Architectural Philosophy:**
    *   Must introduce the core philosophy of the documentation system itself: **Hierarchical Abstraction** and **Domain-Driven Organization**.
    *   Must state that this document is the primary "Level 1" entry point and serves as a guide to the "Level 2" deep-dive documents.
4.  **Architectural Pillars (The Slices):**
    *   A high-level overview of the project's primary architectural subsystems (the "slices").
    *   **Must enumerate and briefly describe all 15 core slices:** `Monorepo & Tooling`, `Build & Bundling`, `Context & Dependency Injection`, `State Management`, `UI & Component System`, `Forms & Validation`, `Integration & Extensibility`, `Step-Based View Management`, `Styling & Theming`, `Asynchronous Loading & Code-Splitting`, `Error Handling`, `Internationalization (I18n)`, `Analytics`, `Testing`, and `Embedded Checkout`.
5.  **Architectural Patterns & Dynamics:**
    *   **Must include a sub-section on `Core Patterns`** that explicitly describes the `Feature-Based Monorepo`, `Functional Components`, `Inter-Package Communication`, and `Co-location` patterns.
    *   **Must include a sub-section on `Application Lifecycle & Data Flow`** that explains the one-way data flow pattern and includes a Mermaid sequence diagram to visualize it.
    *   **Must include a sub-section on `System Dynamics & Extensibility`** that explains the Inversion of Control pattern used for payment module extensibility. This section must include a Mermaid sequence diagram and **explicitly link** to the `03-integration-architecture/02-external-services-guide.md`.
6.  **Folder Structure & Organization:**
    *   **Must provide a descriptive breakdown of the `packages/core/src/` directory.**
    *   **Must explain the `Feature-Based Organization` of the `src/app` directory.**
    *   **Must describe the role of `src/scss` as the home of the `global styling system`.**
7.  **State Management Strategy:**
    *   A clear explanation of the project's two-part state management strategy, explicitly mentioning that it **avoids Redux**.
    *   Must provide the concrete implementation detail of the **`useCheckout()` hook**.
    *   Must **explicitly link** to the `01-application-architecture/02-state-management-guide.md` for implementation details.
8.  **Styling Architecture:**
    *   A high-level description of the styling architecture, including the **`kebab-case`** naming convention.
    *   Must **explicitly link** to `02-design-system/03-styling-guide.md` for implementation details.

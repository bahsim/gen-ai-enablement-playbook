# Spec: The Definitive Documentation Skeleton for `checkout-js`

## 1. Objective

To define and create the **definitive, domain-driven, hierarchical folder and file structure** for the `checkout-js` project's "Living System of Knowledge."

## 2. Rationale: A Domain-Driven Documentation Architecture

This documentation architecture is designed to be a comprehensive, multi-layered system that serves all developers. Its structure is based on the C4 model and modern architectural principles, with a clear separation of concerns organized into distinct, high-cohesion **domains**. It is architected to answer the key questions every developer has, from onboarding to daily work and long-term maintenance.

This spec codifies the following architectural principles:

*   **Hierarchical Abstraction:** The structure is a navigable hierarchy. The **`00-overview/`** domain is the mandatory "Level 1" entry point. It provides the high-level "map of maps" and links to the more granular "Level 2" deep-dive guides within each subsequent domain.
*   **Domain-Driven Organization:** Each folder represents a distinct architectural domain, providing a logical and scalable home for every category of knowledge.
*   **Self-Describing Artifacts:** Every document created must be prepopulated with a standard metadata block to ensure it is self-describing.

## 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the following folder and file structure. Every `.md` file created must be populated with the standard metadata block.

#### Standard Metadata Block:
```markdown
---
**Title:** [Inferred from filename]
**Purpose:** [A one-sentence description of the document's goal]
**Audience:** [The primary audience, e.g., All Developers, Frontend Developers]
**Maintenance:** [The trigger for updating this document, e.g., Review quarterly, Update on API change]
---

# [Inferred Title]
```

#### Skeleton to Create:

*   **`00-overview/`**: The "map of maps" and mandatory starting point for all developers.
    *   `01-architectural-overview.md`: The high-level summary of the system, its purpose, and a guide to the other documentation domains.
    *   `02-glossary-of-terms.md`: The definitive glossary for all technical terms, architectural concepts, and project-specific acronyms.
*   **`01-application-architecture/`**: The "Code" Perspective. Describes the internal architecture of the application itself.
    *   `01-package-architecture-guide.md`: The "macro" view. An introductory guide to the monorepo's package structure and its key integration architectures.
    *   `01-package-architecture-guide/`: A folder containing Level 3 deep-dives on specific package types and integration patterns.
        *   `01-utility-packages-reference.md`: A comprehensive reference for all shared utility packages.
        *   `02-testing-packages-reference.md`: A comprehensive reference for all shared testing packages.
        *   `03-payment-integration-architecture.md`: A deep-dive into the "plugin" architecture for payment gateways.
        *   `04-sdk-integration-architecture.md`: A deep-dive into the patterns for interacting with the BigCommerce SDK.
        *   `05-analytics-integration-architecture.md`: A deep-dive into the architecture for tracking user behavior and performance metrics.
        *   `06-embedded-checkout-architecture.md`: A deep-dive into the patterns for embedding the checkout in third-party sites.
    *   `02-feature-module-guide.md`: The "micro" view. A deep-dive into the internal, feature-based architecture of the `core` application package.
    *   `03-state-management-guide.md`: The deep-dive guide for the State Management slice.
    *   `04-forms-and-validation-guide.md`: The deep-dive guide for the Forms & Validation slice.
    *   `05-view-management-guide.md`: The deep-dive guide for the Step-Based View Management slice.
    *   `06-error-handling-guide.md`: The deep-dive guide for the Error Handling slice.
    *   `07-internationalization-guide.md`: The deep-dive guide for the Internationalization (I18n) slice.
    *   `08-async-loading-guide.md`: The deep-dive guide for the Asynchronous Loading & Code-Splitting slice.
*   **`02-design-system/`**: The "User" Perspective. Describes how the application looks, feels, and behaves.
    *   `01-design-system-philosophy.md`: The principles and rules of the visual language.
    *   `02-component-library-guide.md`: The deep-dive guide for the UI & Component slice.
    *   `03-styling-guide.md`: The deep-dive guide for the Styling & Theming slice.
*   **`03-integration-architecture/`**: The "Connections" Perspective. Describes how the application communicates with the outside world.
    *   `01-api-contracts-guide.md`: Documentation for internal API contracts and data handling patterns.
    *   `02-external-services-guide.md`: The 'wiring diagram' for the Integration & Extensibility slice, detailing the "plugin" architecture for payment providers.
    *   `03-analytics-guide.md`: The deep-dive guide for the Analytics slice.
    *   `04-embedded-checkout-guide.md`: The deep-dive guide for the Embedded Checkout slice.
    *   `05-dependency-injection-guide.md`: The 'wiring diagram' for the Context & Dependency Injection slice.

# Spec: The Definitive Documentation Skeleton for `checkout-js`

## 1. Objective

To define and create the **definitive, domain-driven, hierarchical folder and file structure** for the `checkout-js` project's "Living System of Knowledge."

## 2. Rationale: A Domain-Driven Documentation Architecture

This documentation architecture is designed to be a comprehensive, multi-layered system that serves all developers. Its structure is based on the C4 model and modern architectural principles, with a clear separation of concerns organized into distinct, high-cohesion **domains**. It is architected to answer the key questions every developer has, from onboarding to daily work and long-term maintenance.

This spec codifies the following architectural principles:

*   **Hierarchical Abstraction:** The structure is a navigable hierarchy. The **`00-overview/`** domain is the mandatory "Level 1" entry point. It provides the high-level "map of maps" and links to the more granular "Level 2" deep-dive guides within each subsequent domain.
*   **Domain-Driven Organization:** Each folder represents a distinct architectural domain, providing a logical and scalable home for every category of knowledge.
*   **Self-Describing Artifacts:** Every document created must be prepopulated with a standard metadata block to ensure it is self-describing.

## 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the following folder and file structure. Every `.md` file created must be populated with the standard metadata block.

#### Standard Metadata Block:
```markdown
---
**Title:** [Inferred from filename]
**Purpose:** [A one-sentence description of the document's goal]
**Audience:** [The primary audience, e.g., All Developers, Frontend Developers]
**Maintenance:** [The trigger for updating this document, e.g., Review quarterly, Update on API change]
---

# [Inferred Title]
```

#### Skeleton to Create:

*   **`00-overview/`**: The "map of maps" and mandatory starting point for all developers.
    *   `01-architectural-overview.md`: The high-level summary of the system, its purpose, and a guide to the other documentation domains.
    *   `02-glossary-of-terms.md`: The definitive glossary for all technical terms, architectural concepts, and project-specific acronyms.
*   **`01-application-architecture/`**: The "Code" Perspective. Describes the internal architecture of the application itself.
    *   `01-module-breakdown.md`: A detailed inventory and explanation of the application's feature modules.
    *   `02-state-management-guide.md`: A deep-dive guide to the layered state management strategy and data flow patterns.
    *   `03-forms-and-validation-guide.md`: A practical guide to the project's standardized system for handling user input.
    *   `04-view-management-guide.md`: An explanation of the state-driven system that controls the user's journey through the checkout flow.
    *   `05-error-handling-guide.md`: A guide to the application's centralized error handling and logging system.
    *   `06-internationalization-guide.md`: A guide to the system for managing language translations and localization.
*   **`02-design-system/`**: The "User" Perspective. Describes how the application looks, feels, and behaves.
    *   `01-design-system-philosophy.md`: The principles and rules of the visual language.
    *   `02-component-library-guide.md`: A practical guide for consuming and contributing to the UI component library.
    *   `03-styling-guide.md`: A practical guide for using the project's styling system and conventions.
*   **`03-integration-architecture/`**: The "Connections" Perspective. Describes how the application communicates with the outside world.
    *   `01-api-contracts-guide.md`: Documentation for internal API contracts and data handling patterns.
    *   `02-external-services-guide.md`: A guide to integrating with external systems like the BigCommerce SDK and payment providers.

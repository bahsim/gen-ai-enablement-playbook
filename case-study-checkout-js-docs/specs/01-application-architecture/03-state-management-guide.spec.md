title: Spec: The Definitive State Management "Wiring Diagram"
description: To define the structure and content for the `03-state-management-guide.md`, ensuring it serves as the definitive, end-to-end "wiring diagram" for this Cross-Cutting Concern.
objective: To transform the `03-state-management-guide.md` into the definitive "Single Source of Truth" for the State Management Cross-Cutting Concern (CCC), restructured as a formal "Wiring Diagram".

### 1. Architectural Principles

The documentation for the State Management slice **must** be framed by the following core principles, derived from modern architectural best practices for managing CCCs:

*   **Principle of the Global Slice:** State management is a **governed horizontal slice**. Its purpose is to provide a single, predictable source of truth for all shared application data, preventing the **scattering** of state logic and ensuring data consistency.
*   **Principle of Compositional Decoupling:** The slice must be implemented using a compositional pattern (in this case, a top-level Provider and a Higher-Order Component) that **decouples** the state logic from the feature components that consume it.

### 2. Rationale

The State Management Slice is the central nervous system of the application. A simple description of its parts is insufficient. Developers need a complete, end-to-end mental model—the "wiring diagram"—to understand how this critical CCC is architected to ensure data flows predictably and how to interact with the system safely and effectively.

### 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the `03-state-management-guide.md` file being populated with the following four sections, in order:

1.  **Architectural Philosophy & Pattern:**
    *   Must concisely state that the slice is governed by a **"Centralized State Machine"** pattern.
    *   Must explain the core philosophy: to ensure a single, predictable flow of data where all state mutations are managed exclusively by the `CheckoutService`.
2.  **The Static "Wiring Diagram":**
    *   Must contain a **Mermaid `graph` diagram** that illustrates the static, structural relationships between the key components of the slice.
    *   The diagram must show the `CheckoutProvider` at the root, how the `CheckoutService` is provided to it, and how the `withCheckout` HOC and `useCheckout` hook connect UI components to the central provider.
3.  **A Common Use Case (Sequence Diagram):**
    *   Must contain a comprehensive **Mermaid `sequenceDiagram`** that illustrates a common, end-to-end, system-wide reaction to a state change.
4.  **A Breakdown of the Patterns:**
    *   Must deconstruct the key interaction patterns, using targeted code snippets as evidence for both Action Dispatch and State Access.
5.  **Key Components & Implementation Patterns:**
    *   Must provide a "Cookbook" style section explaining the roles of the `withCheckout` HOC and the `useCheckout()` hook, complete with a practical code recipe.

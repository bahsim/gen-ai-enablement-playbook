title: Spec: The Definitive Package Architecture Documentation Suite
description: To define the structure and content for the `01-package-architecture-guide.md` and its entire suite of Level 3 deep-dive reference documents.
objective: To generate a hierarchical documentation suite for the monorepo's package architecture, which constitutes the project's governed **horizontal (technical/global) slices**.
---

### 1. Architectural Principles

The documentation for the package architecture **must** be framed by the following core principles, derived from modern architectural best practices for managing a hybrid slicing model:

*   **Principle of the Hybrid Model:** The architecture supports both highly cohesive domain logic (maintained through **vertical slicing** within features) and highly reusable, decoupled infrastructure components (maintained through the **horizontal slicing** of these packages). This pragmatic hybrid is necessary to achieve high scalability and maintainability.
*   **Principle of Dependency Governance:** The horizontal slices (packages) documented here must be treated as downward-facing infrastructure. They must be entirely **agnostic of specific business features** and must never introduce dependencies *on* those features. This strict "upward" dependency flow is critical for stability, testability, and reuse.

### 2. Rationale

This hierarchical structure adheres to our "Hierarchical Abstraction" principle. It allows developers to first understand the high-level concepts and patterns from the main introductory guide before optionally diving into the exhaustive details contained within the focused, deep-dive reference documents. This prevents overwhelming the reader while still providing comprehensive information on the project's crucial shared infrastructure.

### 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the following file structure and content:

#### 3.1. The "Level 2" Introductory Guide

The file `01-package-architecture-guide.md` must serve as the introductory map. It must contain:
1.  **Core Principles:** A summary of the key architectural principles (Modularity, Component-Based, State Management, Type Safety).
2.  **High-Level Diagram:** The `mermaid` diagram from the archive that illustrates the relationship between the SDK, State, HOCs, and UI Components.
3.  **Monorepo Package Categories:** A brief, high-level list of the four main package categories (`core`, `payment-integrations`, `utility-packages`, `testing-packages`).
4.  **Key Integration Architectures:** A brief, high-level list of the major integration patterns discovered (`Payment Gateway`, `SDK`, `Analytics`, `Embedded Checkout`).
5.  **Links to Deep-Dives:** Both the "Package Categories" and "Integration Architectures" sections must provide clear, relative links to the corresponding "Level 3" deep-dive documents in the `01-package-architecture-guide/` sub-folder.
6.  **Developer's Guide:** A concise guide to the rules for inter-package communication using TypeScript path aliases.

#### 3.2. The "Level 3" Deep-Dive Guides

The following files must exist inside the `01-application-architecture/01-package-architecture-guide/` directory and contain the specified, high-quality content:

1.  **`01-utility-packages-reference.md`:** Must contain two sections:
    *   A detailed markdown table inventorying all key utility packages.
    *   A **"Developer Cookbook"** section with practical, copy-pasteable code examples ("recipes") for common tasks, including:
        *   "Recipe: Building a Form with Standard UI Components" (using the `ui` package).
        *   "Recipe: Translating a String" (using the `locale` package).
2.  **`02-testing-packages-reference.md`:** Must contain two sections:
    *   A detailed markdown table inventorying all key testing packages.
    *   A **"Developer Cookbook"** section providing a complete, "golden path" code example for "Recipe: Writing a Standard Component Test," demonstrating how to use `test-utils` and `test-mocks` together.
3.  **`03-payment-integration-architecture.md`:** Must contain a comprehensive explanation of the **Strategy Pattern** for payment integrations, including the contract, factory, a `mermaid` sequence diagram, and a concrete code example.
4.  **`04-sdk-integration-architecture.md`:** Must explain the primary pattern for accessing checkout state: the **`withCheckout` Higher-Order Component (HOC)**. It must detail the reactive data flow: `User Interaction` -> `Action Dispatch` -> `SDK Logic` -> `State Propagation` -> `Re-render`.
5.  **`05-analytics-integration-architecture.md`:** Must explain the patterns for **Event Tracking**, **Performance Metrics**, **Error Logging**, and **Conversion Tracking**.
6.  **`06-embedded-checkout-architecture.md`:** Must explain the patterns for **Messenger Communication** (parent-child window), **Style Injection**, and **Cross-frame Event Handling**.

title: Spec: Internationalization (I18n) Guide
description: To define the structure and content for the guide to the Internationalization Cross-Cutting Concern.
objective: To generate a comprehensive guide that documents the Internationalization (I18n) Cross-Cutting Concern (CCC) as a governed, horizontal architectural slice.
---

### 1. Architectural Principles

The documentation for the I18n slice **must** be framed by the following core principles, derived from modern architectural best practices for managing CCCs:

*   **Principle of the Horizontal Slice:** Internationalization is a **governed horizontal slice**. Its purpose is to provide a centralized system for managing and consuming translated content.
*   **Principle of Decoupling:** The slice uses a compositional pattern (`<LocaleProvider>` and `withLanguage` HOC / `useLanguage` hook) to **decouple** user-facing strings from the component code. This prevents the **tangling** of content with presentation logic, which is critical for maintainability and scalability.

### 2. Rationale

The checkout application must support multiple languages. This guide is crucial for documenting how this critical CCC is architected to ensure that all user-facing content can be translated without modifying the components that display it.

### 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the `06-internationalization-guide.md` file being populated with the following:

1.  **The I18n System:**
    *   Must identify the core components of the internationalization system from the `packages/locale` package, explaining how they function as a cohesive, decoupled slice:
        *   **`<LocaleProvider>`**: The top-level provider that bootstraps the system.
        *   **`LanguageService`**: The service responsible for loading translation files.

2.  **Consuming Translations in a Component:**
    *   Must describe the primary pattern for accessing the translation function. This includes the `withLanguage` Higher-Order Component (HOC) and the modern `useLanguage()` hook, which injects the `language.translate()` method.
    *   Must provide a clear, practical code example of a React component using the `language.translate()` method with a translation key.

3.  **Translation Files:**
    *   Must explain that translations are stored in JSON files.
    *   Must describe the convention for the location and structure of these files (e.g., `packages/core/src/app/locale/translations/en.json`).
    *   Must explain the key-value format used within the JSON files.

title: Spec: Forms and Validation Guide
description: To define the structure and content for the guide to the Forms and Validation Cross-Cutting Concern.
objective: To generate a comprehensive guide that documents the Forms & Validation Cross-Cutting Concern (CCC) as a governed, horizontal architectural slice.
---

### 1. Architectural Principles

The documentation for the Forms & Validation slice **must** be framed by the following core principles, derived from modern architectural best practices for managing CCCs:

*   **Principle of the Horizontal Slice:** Forms and validation are a **governed horizontal slice**. This architecture provides a standardized, reusable set of tools and patterns for all user input, preventing the **scattering and tangling** of form state logic and validation rules across dozens of feature components.
*   **Principle of Decoupling:** The slice **decouples** validation logic from component logic. This is achieved by defining validation rules in independent, reusable schemas that are then provided to the form components, rather than writing validation logic directly inside the components.

### 2. Rationale

Nearly every step of the checkout process involves a form. This guide is crucial for documenting how this critical CCC is architected to ensure consistency, security, and a good user experience, while preventing the degradation of code quality that comes from scattered and tangled logic.

### 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the `03-forms-and-validation-guide.md` file being populated with the following sections:

1.  **Core Technologies:**
    *   Must clearly explain the roles of the two primary libraries: **Formik** for form state management and **Yup** for schema-based validation, explaining how they work together to form a cohesive, decoupled slice.

2.  **Standard Implementation Pattern:**
    *   Must provide a complete, practical code example of a standard form component.
    *   The example must demonstrate:
        *   Wrapping the form with the `<Formik>` provider.
        *   Defining a `validationSchema` using a `Yup.object()`.
        *   Using shared form components from the `@bigcommerce/checkout/ui` package (e.g., `BasicFormField`, `CheckboxFormField`).
        *   Connecting components to Formik state using the component's `name` prop.
        *   Handling form submission via the `onSubmit` prop.

3.  **Dynamic Forms:**
    *   Must reference the `DynamicFormField` component and explain its purpose for rendering forms based on a configuration object (e.g., for payment methods that define their own fields).

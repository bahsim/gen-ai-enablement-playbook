# Spec: Forms and Validation Guide

## 1. Objective

To analyze the `C:\learn\checkout-js` project and generate the complete content for the **`01-application-architecture/03-forms-and-validation-guide.md`** document.

## 2. Rationale

Nearly every step of the checkout process involves a form. A practical, example-driven guide to the project's standardized approach to forms and validation is crucial for ensuring consistency, security, and a good user experience.

## 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the `01-application-architecture/03-forms-and-validation-guide.md` file being populated with the following sections:

1.  **Core Technologies:**
    *   Must clearly explain the roles of the two primary libraries: **Formik** for form state management and **Yup** for schema-based validation.

2.  **Standard Implementation Pattern:**
    *   Must provide a complete, practical code example of a standard form component.
    *   The example must demonstrate:
        *   Wrapping the form with the `<Formik>` provider.
        *   Defining a `validationSchema` using a `Yup.object()`.
        *   Using shared form components from the `@bigcommerce/checkout/ui` package (e.g., `BasicFormField`, `CheckboxFormField`).
        *   Connecting components to Formik state using the component's `name` prop.
        *   Handling form submission via the `onSubmit` prop.

3.  **Dynamic Forms:**
    *   Must reference the `DynamicFormField` component and explain its purpose for rendering forms based on a configuration object (e.g., for payment methods that define their own fields).

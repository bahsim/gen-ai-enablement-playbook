title: Spec: Async Loading Guide
description: To define the structure and content for the guide to the Async Loading & Code-Splitting Cross-Cutting Concern.
objective: To generate a comprehensive guide that documents the Async Loading & Code-Splitting Cross-Cutting Concern (CCC) as a performance-focused horizontal slice.
---

### 1. Architectural Principles

The documentation for the Async Loading slice **must** be framed by the following core principles:

*   **Principle of Performance Optimization:** This slice is a **governed horizontal slice** focused on performance. Its purpose is to improve the application's initial load time and overall responsiveness by deferring the loading of non-critical code and components until they are actually needed.
*   **Principle of Progressive Enhancement:** The slice enables a strategy of progressive enhancement. The core, critical-path user experience is delivered as quickly as possible, and secondary or heavy components are loaded on demand.

### 2. Rationale

Large, monolithic JavaScript bundles are a primary cause of slow web applications. This guide is crucial for documenting how the project architecturally manages this performance concern, ensuring that developers have a clear, standardized pattern for code-splitting and asynchronously loading components.

### 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the `07-async-loading-guide.md` file being populated with the following sections:

1.  **Core Technologies:**
    *   Must clearly explain the roles of the two primary React APIs used to implement this slice:
        *   **`React.lazy()`**: The function for declaring a dynamically imported component.
        *   **`<Suspense>`**: The component for specifying a loading indicator (fallback UI) while a lazy-loaded component is being fetched.

2.  **Developer Cookbook: Lazily Loading a Component:**
    *   Must provide a complete, practical code example of the standard implementation pattern.
    *   The example must demonstrate:
        *   How to use `React.lazy()` with a dynamic `import()` statement to define a lazy component.
        *   How to use the `<Suspense>` component to wrap the lazy component.
        *   How to provide a simple, effective `fallback` prop (e.g., a `<LoadingSpinner />`) to the `<Suspense>` component.
        *   How to render the lazy component as part of a standard component's render method.

# Spec: Error Handling Guide

## 1. Objective

To analyze the `C:\learn\checkout-js` project and its legacy documentation to generate the complete content for the **`01-application-architecture/05-error-handling-guide.md`** document.

## 2. Rationale

A robust error handling strategy is essential for a production-grade application. This guide must provide developers with a clear, practical understanding of the project's centralized system for catching, logging, displaying, and recovering from errors.

## 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the `01-application-architecture/05-error-handling-guide.md` file being populated with the following sections:

1.  **The Error Handling Stack:**
    *   Must describe the key components of the error handling system and their packages:
        *   **`<ErrorBoundary>`** (`packages/error-handling-utils`): The top-level React component for catching rendering errors.
        *   **`ErrorLogger`** (`packages/error-handling-utils`): The centralized service for reporting errors to external systems (like Sentry).
        *   **`<ErrorModal>`** (`packages/core`): The UI component for displaying user-friendly error messages.

2.  **Custom Error Types:**
    *   Must explain the purpose of using custom error classes.
    *   Must describe the primary custom error types, such as `RequestError` (for API failures) and `CartChangedError` (for stale data conflicts).

3.  **Standard Implementation Pattern:**
    *   Must provide a practical code example of the standard `try...catch` pattern for handling errors within asynchronous logic (e.g., form submission).
    *   The example must show how to catch an error and report it to the `ErrorLogger` service.

4.  **Error Recovery:**
    *   Must explain the concept of error recovery in the context of the checkout.
    *   Must describe how `CartChangedError` is used to trigger a page reload to recover from a stale checkout state.

title: Spec: The Definitive Feature Module Guide
description: To define the structure and content for the `02-feature-module-guide.md`, which documents the project's vertical slicing strategy.
objective: To generate the definitive content for the guide to the `core` application's internal feature modules, which constitute the project's **vertical (feature/domain) slices**.

### 1. Architectural Principles

The documentation for the feature module architecture **must** be framed by the following core principles, derived from modern architectural best practices for managing a hybrid slicing model:

*   **Principle of Vertical Slicing:** This architecture organizes code around vertical segments of business functionality. The primary goal is the **encapsulation of business logic** to improve long-term maintainability and support rapid feature delivery.
*   **Principle of Cohesion:** All technical elements required to execute a business function—the UI, the local state, and the orchestration of calls to horizontal services—must be **co-located** within a single, business-scoped unit.

### 2. Rationale

This document details the project's **vertical slicing strategy**, which is the "micro" view of the `core` application's internal architecture. It is the necessary counterpart to the **horizontal slicing** of the monorepo packages. By documenting both, we provide a complete picture of the project's hybrid architectural model, adhering to the principle of Separation of Concerns.

### 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the `02-feature-module-guide.md` file being populated with the following sections:

1.  **Architectural Principle: Feature-Based Organization:**
    *   Must explain the core philosophy of organizing code by domain features (`address/`, `cart/`) rather than by code type.
    *   Must detail the key benefits: High Cohesion, Low Coupling, and Discoverability.
2.  **Core Application Feature Modules:**
    *   Must analyze the `packages/core/src/app` directory.
    *   Must present the findings in a **table** with columns for **Module**, **Primary Responsibility**, and **Key Components**.
    *   Must cover the primary feature modules (e.g., `address`, `cart`, `billing`, `payment`, `customer`, `shipping`, `order`).
3.  **Developer's Guide: The Principle of Co-location:**
    *   Must provide a practical, prescriptive guide for developers.
    *   Must explain and provide a code-block example of the `Component.tsx`, `Component.scss`, and `Component.test.tsx` file structure within a feature module directory.

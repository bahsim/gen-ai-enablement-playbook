# Spec: Populate the Glossary of Terms

## 1. Objective

To analyze the `00-overview/01-architectural-overview.md` document and generate the complete content for the **`00-overview/02-glossary-of-terms.md`** document.

## 2. Rationale

A shared, explicit vocabulary is essential for effective communication and onboarding. This spec ensures the creation of a centralized glossary that is directly derived from the terminology used in the primary architectural overview. This guarantees the glossary is both relevant and accurate, providing a definitive "legend" for the project's architectural "map" and all subsequent documentation.

## 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the `00-overview/02-glossary-of-terms.md` file being populated with a comprehensive list of architectural terms and their definitions.

The process must be as follows:

1.  **Analyze Source:** Read and parse the `00-overview/01-architectural-overview.md` document.
2.  **Extract Terms:** Identify all major architectural concepts, project-specific vocabulary, and technical acronyms. The list must include, at a minimum:
    *   Architectural Domain
    *   Architectural Pillar
    *   Architectural Slice
    *   CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment)
    *   Co-location
    *   Defense in Depth
    *   HOC (Higher-Order Component)
    *   IoC (Inversion of Control)
    *   Monorepo
    *   SDK (Software Development Kit)
3.  **Define Terms:** Provide a clear, concise, and project-specific definition for each extracted term.
4.  **Populate Target:** Format the output with each term as a heading and its definition below it. The terms must be organized alphabetically in the `00-overview/02-glossary-of-terms.md` file.

# Spec: Documentation Skeleton for `checkout-js`

## 1. Objective

To define and create the optimal, hierarchical folder and file structure (the "skeleton") for the documentation of the `C:\learn\checkout-js` project.

## 2. Rationale

This documentation skeleton will serve as the foundational blueprint for a comprehensive "Living Documentation Standard" for the project. The goal is to create a structure that is:
*   **Logically Organized:** Easy for human developers to navigate and contribute to.
*   **Machine-Readable:** Optimized for an AI assistant to use as a high-quality context source for future development and onboarding tasks.
*   **Aligned with the Playbook:** Directly implements the principles of "The Frontend Documentation Suite" defined in our playbook.

This spec-driven approach ensures we design the full documentation structure thoughtfully before generating any content, preventing "vibe-driven" garbage.

## 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the following folder and file structure being created inside the `case-study-checkout-js-docs/` directory:

*   **`README.md`**: An overview of the documentation suite and a guide on how to use and maintain it.
*   **`01-strategic-documents/`**: A directory for the high-level, "big picture" documentation.
    *   **`01-architectural-overview.md`**: A document describing the high-level architecture, folder structure, and core design patterns of the `checkout-js` application.
    *   **`02-user-flow-diagrams.md`**: A placeholder for visual diagrams of the most critical user journeys (e.g., standard checkout, guest checkout).
    *   **`03-design-system-philosophy.md`**: A document outlining the principles of the visual language and linking to any component libraries (e.g., Storybook).
*   **`02-tactical-guides/`**: A directory for the ground-level, practical "how-to" documentation for daily development.
    *   **`01-state-management-guide.md`**: A definitive guide on how client-side state is managed.
    *   **`02-api-contracts-and-data-handling.md`**: A guide on how the frontend interacts with APIs, including data fetching, transformation, and error handling.
    *   **`03-styling-guide.md`**: A guide to ensure styling is consistent, maintainable, and scalable.
    *   **`04-testing-strategy.md`**: A document outlining the strategy for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
    *   **`05-component-library-usage.md`**: Practical instructions for using the interactive component library.
*   **`03-adrs/`**: A directory to hold Architectural Decision Records that explain the rationale behind key technical choices.
    *   **`template.md`**: A template for creating new ADRs.

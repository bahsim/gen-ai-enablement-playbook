# **Checkout-JS Documentation Suite**

This documentation suite is the single source of truth for the `checkout-js` project. It is a **living, machine-readable knowledge base** designed to be the primary source of high-quality context for both human developers and their AI assistants.

**How to Use This Documentation:**
*   **For Onboarding:** Follow the numbered documents sequentially, starting with the `01-strategic-documents` and proceeding to the `02-tactical-guides`.
*   **For Daily Development:** Use these documents as the primary source of context when briefing your AI assistant for a new task.
*   **As a Contributor:** If you make a change to the system, you must first update the relevant document in this suite. The documentation is not an afterthought; it is a prerequisite for action.

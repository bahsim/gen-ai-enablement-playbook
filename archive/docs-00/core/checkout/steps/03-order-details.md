# Order Details Step - Explained

## Core Responsibility & Design

The Order Details step is a **structural placeholder** in the checkout flow. Unlike other steps, it **does not render a complex, unique component** with its own forms or significant logic. Its primary purpose is to act as a formal step in the sequence before the final payment and confirmation.

This is a critical distinction from previous fabricated documentation. The `renderOrderDetailsStep` method within `Checkout.tsx` simply renders a generic `CheckoutStep` component with a title.

## Implementation Details

-   **Component Rendered**: `CheckoutStep` (the generic step container).
-   **Unique Logic**: None. The component receives the standard step props (`isActive`, `isComplete`, etc.) but has no specialized implementation within `Checkout.tsx`.
-   **Data Display**: It does not display any order summary or details itself. That information is part of the `CartSummary` component, which is rendered separately in the layout.
-   **User Interaction**: The only interactions are the standard "Edit" button and step expansion, which are handled by the parent `Checkout` orchestrator.

## Role in the Checkout Flow

The `OrderDetails` step is positioned **after** the `Shipping` step and **before** the `BillingAndPayment` step.

Its main function is to provide a clear point in the UX where the user has submitted their customer and shipping information and is about to proceed to the final payment actions. It serves as a logical separation point in the state machine managed by `Checkout.tsx`.

## Key Takeaway

It is essential to understand that `OrderDetails` is not a feature-rich component. It is a lightweight, structural element in the checkout orchestration, and any documentation suggesting otherwise is a fabrication.

# Shared Components - Core Package

## Overview

This folder contains documentation for **shared components** that are used by both the **checkout flow** and **order confirmation flow**. These components provide common functionality that is needed across both flows.

## Shared Components

### 1. Address Component (`01-address.md`)
**Purpose**: Shared address management functionality
**Usage**: Used in both checkout (shipping/billing addresses) and order confirmation (order address display)
**Key Features**:
- Address form management and validation
- Google Maps autocomplete integration
- Country-specific validation rules
- Address utilities and mapping

### 2. Cart Component (`02-cart.md`)
**Purpose**: Shared cart management functionality
**Usage**: Used in both checkout (cart summary) and order confirmation (order summary)
**Key Features**:
- Cart summary display and management
- Item management and updates
- Redeemable management (coupons, gift certificates)
- Summary calculations and totals

### 3. Customer Component (`03-customer.md`)
**Purpose**: Shared customer management functionality
**Usage**: Used in both checkout (customer authentication) and order confirmation (guest account creation)
**Key Features**:
- Customer authentication and session management
- Account creation and profile management
- Guest flow management
- Customer validation and utilities

### 4. Analytics Component (`04-analytics.md`)
**Purpose**: Shared analytics functionality
**Usage**: Used in both checkout (checkout analytics) and order confirmation (completion analytics)
**Key Features**:
- Event tracking and user behavior monitoring
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Analytics service integration
- Conversion tracking and reporting

### 5. UI Component (`05-ui.md`)
**Purpose**: Shared UI components and utilities
**Usage**: Used throughout both checkout and order confirmation flows
**Key Features**:
- Form components and inputs
- Layout components and structure
- Interactive components and modals
- Styling system and theming

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Shared Functionality
- **Common Logic**: Components that contain logic used by both flows
- **Reusable Components**: UI components that can be used in multiple contexts
- **Shared Utilities**: Utility functions and helpers used across flows

### 2. Flow Independence
- **No Flow Dependencies**: Shared components should not depend on specific flow logic
- **Generic Interfaces**: Components should use generic interfaces and props
- **Flow Agnostic**: Components should work regardless of which flow uses them

### 3. Consistent Experience
- **Unified UI**: Consistent user interface across both flows
- **Shared Styling**: Common styling and theming system
- **Consistent Behavior**: Consistent component behavior across flows

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Checkout Flow Integration
- **Address Management**: Shipping and billing address collection
- **Cart Display**: Cart summary and item management
- **Customer Authentication**: Customer login and account creation
- **Analytics Tracking**: Checkout flow analytics and events
- **UI Components**: Form inputs, buttons, and layout components

### 2. Order Confirmation Flow Integration
- **Address Display**: Order address display and formatting
- **Order Summary**: Order summary and item display
- **Guest Account Creation**: Guest account creation after order
- **Completion Analytics**: Order completion analytics and events
- **UI Components**: Display components, layout, and interactive elements

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Component Design
- **Generic Props**: Use generic props that work across flows
- **Flow Agnostic**: Avoid flow-specific logic in shared components
- **Reusable Logic**: Extract reusable logic into utilities

### 2. State Management
- **Local State**: Use local component state when possible
- **Context Sharing**: Use React Context for shared state
- **Prop Drilling**: Minimize prop drilling with proper state management

### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component integration with both flows
- **Flow Tests**: Test components in both checkout and order confirmation contexts

## Future Considerations

### 1. Enhanced Shared Components
- **Additional Components**: More shared components as needed
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Improved shared component functionality
- **Better Integration**: Enhanced integration with both flows

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Component Performance**: Shared component performance optimization
- **Bundle Optimization**: Shared component bundle optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Shared component lazy loading strategies

### 3. Developer Experience
- **Component Documentation**: Enhanced component documentation
- **Usage Examples**: Better usage examples and patterns
- **Development Tools**: Enhanced development tools and utilities

# Payment Processing Logic

## Logic Name: Payment Method Selection and Processing

**Purpose**: Manages payment method selection, validation, and processing through various payment gateways and methods.

**Context**: Triggered when user selects a payment method, during form validation, and when processing payment submission. Handles both hosted and embedded payment flows.

**Inputs**:
- `paymentMethods`: Available payment methods from store configuration
- `selectedMethod`: Currently selected payment method
- `paymentData`: Payment form data and credentials
- `billingAddress`: Billing address for payment validation
- `orderTotal`: Total amount to be charged

**Logic Flow**:
- Determines available payment methods based on store configuration
- Validates payment method selection
- Handles payment form rendering and validation
- Manages payment processing through appropriate gateway
- Handles payment success/failure scenarios

**Outputs**:
- `paymentStatus`: Success, failure, or pending status
- `paymentError`: Any payment processing errors
- `transactionId`: Payment transaction identifier
- `paymentMethod`: Confirmed payment method used

**Dependencies**:
- PaymentGatewayService: For payment processing
- ValidationService: For payment form validation
- BillingService: For billing address validation
- AnalyticsService: For payment tracking

**Dependents**:
- Order confirmation depends on successful payment
- Error handling components show payment errors
- Analytics track payment events
- Receipt generation uses payment data

**Business Rules**:
- Payment methods must be enabled in store settings
- Billing address required for payment processing
- Payment amount must match order total
- Payment methods have country/currency restrictions

**Edge Cases**:
- Payment method becomes unavailable during checkout
- Network timeout during payment processing
- Payment gateway returns unexpected response
- User abandons payment process
- Multiple payment attempts

**Error Conditions**:
- `PaymentMethodError`: Invalid payment method selection
- `PaymentProcessingError`: Gateway processing failure
- `ValidationError`: Payment form validation failure
- `NetworkError`: Connection issues during payment
- `InsufficientFundsError`: Payment declined

**Performance Impact**:
- Lazy loading of payment method components
- Debounced payment form validation
- Optimized payment gateway calls
- Cached payment method configurations

**Security Considerations**:
- PCI compliance for credit card handling
- Secure tokenization of payment data
- Fraud protection integration
- Secure communication with payment gateways

**Testing Scenarios**:
- Valid payment method selection
- Invalid payment credentials
- Payment gateway failures
- Network timeout scenarios
- Multiple payment attempts
- Payment method unavailability

**Maintenance Notes**:
- Payment gateway configurations may change
- New payment methods require integration
- Security updates for PCI compliance
- Performance monitoring for payment processing

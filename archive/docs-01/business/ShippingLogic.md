# Shipping Logic

## Logic Name: Shipping Calculation and Selection

**Purpose**: Handles shipping address validation, shipping method calculation, and shipping option selection.

**Context**: Triggered when shipping address is entered, when calculating shipping costs, and when selecting shipping methods. Manages both single and multi-address shipping.

**Inputs**:
- `shippingAddress`: Destination shipping address
- `cartItems`: Items to be shipped
- `shippingMethods`: Available shipping options
- `isMultiShipping`: Whether multi-address shipping is enabled
- `shippingPreferences`: Customer shipping preferences

**Logic Flow**:
- Validates shipping address
- Calculates available shipping methods
- Determines shipping costs
- Handles shipping method selection
- Manages multi-address shipping if enabled

**Outputs**:
- `availableShippingMethods`: Calculated shipping options
- `shippingCosts`: Cost breakdown for each method
- `selectedShippingMethod`: Chosen shipping option
- `shippingValidation`: Address validation results

**Dependencies**:
- ShippingService: For shipping calculations
- AddressService: For address validation
- CartService: For cart item details
- TaxService: For shipping tax calculations

**Dependents**:
- Checkout flow depends on shipping selection
- Order total includes shipping costs
- Analytics track shipping choices
- Customer service uses shipping data

**Business Rules**:
- Shipping address must be valid
- Shipping methods depend on destination
- Shipping costs vary by method and location
- Multi-address shipping has restrictions

**Edge Cases**:
- Invalid shipping address
- No shipping methods available
- Shipping cost calculation errors
- Multi-address shipping conflicts
- International shipping restrictions

**Error Conditions**:
- `InvalidAddressError`: Shipping address invalid
- `NoShippingMethodsError`: No shipping options available
- `ShippingCalculationError`: Cost calculation failed
- `RestrictedShippingError`: Shipping not available to destination
- `MultiShippingError`: Multi-address shipping issues

**Performance Impact**:
- Cached shipping calculations
- Optimized address validation
- Lazy loading of shipping methods
- Efficient cost calculations

**Security Considerations**:
- Validate shipping addresses
- Secure shipping cost calculations
- Protect customer shipping data
- Prevent shipping fraud

**Testing Scenarios**:
- Valid shipping address
- Invalid address formats
- International shipping
- Multi-address shipping
- Shipping cost calculations
- Shipping method availability

**Maintenance Notes**:
- Shipping carrier integration updates
- Address validation rule changes
- Shipping cost calculation updates
- Performance monitoring for shipping calculations

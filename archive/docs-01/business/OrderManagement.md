# Order Management Logic

## Logic Name: Order Creation and Confirmation

**Purpose**: Handles order creation, confirmation, and status management throughout the checkout process.

**Context**: Triggered when payment is successful, during order confirmation, and when tracking order status. Manages the transition from checkout to completed order.

**Inputs**:
- `orderData`: Complete order information
- `paymentConfirmation`: Payment processing results
- `customerInfo`: Customer details for the order
- `shippingInfo`: Shipping address and method
- `billingInfo`: Billing address and payment method

**Logic Flow**:
- Validates order completeness
- Creates order record in system
- Processes payment confirmation
- Sends order confirmation notifications
- Updates order status
- Handles order fulfillment

**Outputs**:
- `orderId`: Unique order identifier
- `orderStatus`: Current order status
- `confirmationData`: Order confirmation details
- `trackingInfo`: Order tracking information

**Dependencies**:
- OrderService: For order creation and management
- PaymentService: For payment confirmation
- NotificationService: For order notifications
- InventoryService: For stock management

**Dependents**:
- Order confirmation page displays order details
- Email notifications use order data
- Analytics track order completion
- Customer service uses order information

**Business Rules**:
- Order must have valid payment confirmation
- All required order data must be present
- Order status must be tracked
- Customer must receive confirmation

**Edge Cases**:
- Payment confirmation fails after order creation
- Inventory changes during order processing
- Network errors during order creation
- Duplicate order creation
- Order data corruption

**Error Conditions**:
- `OrderCreationError`: Failed to create order
- `PaymentConfirmationError`: Payment not confirmed
- `InventoryError`: Insufficient stock
- `NetworkError`: Connection issues
- `DuplicateOrderError`: Order already exists

**Performance Impact**:
- Optimized order creation process
- Cached order status lookups
- Efficient order data storage
- Background order processing

**Security Considerations**:
- Secure order data storage
- Payment data protection
- Order access controls
- Audit trail for order changes

**Testing Scenarios**:
- Successful order creation
- Payment confirmation failure
- Inventory shortage scenarios
- Network error handling
- Duplicate order prevention
- Order status updates

**Maintenance Notes**:
- Order data retention policies
- Payment system integration updates
- Notification system maintenance
- Performance monitoring for order processing

# Customer Management Logic

## Logic Name: Customer Authentication and Data Management

**Purpose**: Handles customer authentication, profile management, and customer-specific checkout flows.

**Context**: Triggered during customer login, profile updates, and when determining checkout flow type. Manages both authenticated and guest customer experiences.

**Inputs**:
- `customerCredentials`: Login credentials (email/password)
- `customerProfile`: Customer profile data
- `isGuestEnabled`: Whether guest checkout is allowed
- `customerAddresses`: Saved customer addresses
- `customerPreferences`: Customer-specific settings

**Logic Flow**:
- Determines customer authentication status
- Manages customer login/logout flows
- Handles customer profile data
- Manages saved addresses and preferences
- Determines checkout flow type based on customer status

**Outputs**:
- `customerStatus`: Authenticated, guest, or unknown
- `customerData`: Customer profile information
- `checkoutFlow`: Customer-specific checkout flow
- `savedAddresses`: Available customer addresses

**Dependencies**:
- AuthenticationService: For customer login/logout
- CustomerService: For profile management
- AddressService: For saved addresses
- PreferenceService: For customer settings

**Dependents**:
- Checkout flow depends on customer status
- Address forms use saved addresses
- Payment methods depend on customer type
- Analytics track customer behavior

**Business Rules**:
- Guest checkout only if enabled in store
- Authenticated customers can save addresses
- Customer data must be validated
- Privacy compliance for customer data

**Edge Cases**:
- Customer session expires during checkout
- Customer changes email during checkout
- Network errors during authentication
- Invalid customer credentials
- Customer account locked

**Error Conditions**:
- `AuthenticationError`: Login failure
- `SessionExpiredError`: Customer session expired
- `ValidationError`: Customer data validation failure
- `NetworkError`: Connection issues
- `AccountLockedError`: Customer account locked

**Performance Impact**:
- Cached customer authentication status
- Lazy loading of customer data
- Optimized address lookups
- Debounced profile updates

**Security Considerations**:
- Secure password handling
- Session management
- Data encryption for customer data
- Privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA)

**Testing Scenarios**:
- Valid customer login
- Invalid credentials
- Session expiration
- Guest checkout flow
- Customer profile updates
- Address management

**Maintenance Notes**:
- Authentication system updates
- Privacy regulation compliance
- Customer data retention policies
- Security monitoring and updates

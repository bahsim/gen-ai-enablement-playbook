# Payment Data Flow Logic

## Logic Name: Payment Processing Data Flow

**Purpose**: Manages the flow of payment data through the checkout system, from selection to processing and confirmation.

**Context**: Triggered when payment method is selected, during payment form submission, and when processing payment through gateways.

**Inputs**:
- `paymentMethod`: Selected payment method
- `paymentData`: Payment form data
- `billingAddress`: Billing address for payment
- `orderTotal`: Amount to be charged
- `customerInfo`: Customer payment preferences

**Logic Flow**:
- Validates payment method selection
- Processes payment form data
- Communicates with payment gateway
- Handles payment confirmation
- Updates order with payment status

**Outputs**:
- `paymentStatus`: Success, failure, or pending
- `transactionId`: Payment transaction identifier
- `paymentConfirmation`: Gateway confirmation data
- `orderUpdate`: Updated order with payment info

**Dependencies**:
- PaymentGatewayService: For payment processing
- ValidationService: For payment form validation
- BillingService: For billing address validation
- OrderService: For order updates

**Dependents**:
- Order confirmation depends on payment success
- Error handling shows payment errors
- Analytics track payment events
- Customer service uses payment data

**Business Rules**:
- Payment method must be valid and available
- Billing address required for payment
- Payment amount must match order total
- Payment methods have country/currency restrictions

**Edge Cases**:
- Payment method becomes unavailable
- Network timeout during payment
- Payment gateway returns unexpected response
- User abandons payment process
- Multiple payment attempts

**Error Conditions**:
- `PaymentMethodError`: Invalid payment method
- `PaymentProcessingError`: Gateway processing failure
- `ValidationError`: Payment form validation failure
- `NetworkError`: Connection issues
- `InsufficientFundsError`: Payment declined

**Performance Impact**:
- Optimized payment gateway calls
- Cached payment method configurations
- Efficient payment data processing
- Background payment status updates

**Security Considerations**:
- PCI compliance for credit card handling
- Secure tokenization of payment data
- Fraud protection integration
- Secure communication with gateways

**Testing Scenarios**:
- Valid payment processing
- Invalid payment credentials
- Payment gateway failures
- Network timeout scenarios
- Multiple payment attempts
- Payment method unavailability

**Maintenance Notes**:
- Payment gateway configuration updates
- Security updates for PCI compliance
- Performance monitoring for payments
- Integration updates for new gateways

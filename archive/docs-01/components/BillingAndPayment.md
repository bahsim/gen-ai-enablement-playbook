# BillingAndPayment Component - High-Level Overview

## Purpose
The BillingAndPayment component orchestrates the combined billing and payment flow in the checkout process. It serves as a unified container that manages the interaction between billing address collection and payment method selection.

## Architecture
- **Type**: Functional component with hooks
- **State Management**: Uses `useBillingAndPayment` hook for state coordination
- **Composition**: Combines Payment and Billing components with unified submit flow
- **Integration**: Wrapped with analytics and context HOCs

## Key Responsibilities
1. **Flow Coordination**: Manages the sequence from billing to payment submission
2. **State Synchronization**: Ensures both billing and payment are ready before allowing submission
3. **Unified Interface**: Provides single "Place Order" button for entire flow
4. **Error Handling**: Centralizes error management across billing and payment

## Component Structure
- **Payment Section**: Renders Payment component with embedded checkout support
- **Billing Section**: Renders Billing component with address collection
- **Submit Button**: Single "Place Order" button that triggers the entire flow

## State Management
- **isBillingReady**: Tracks billing form completion status
- **isPaymentReady**: Tracks payment form completion status
- **submitBilling**: Function to trigger billing submission
- **submitPayment**: Function to trigger payment submission

## Flow Logic
1. User fills billing and payment forms
2. Both components report ready state
3. User clicks "Place Order" button
4. Billing submission triggers first
5. Payment submission follows after billing success
6. Order finalization completes the process

## Integration Points
- **Checkout Component**: Rendered as part of billing and payment step
- **Analytics**: Tracks user interactions and completion events
- **Error Handling**: Propagates errors up to checkout level
- **Embedded Checkout**: Supports embedded checkout scenarios

## Performance Considerations
- Uses `useCallback` for event handler memoization
- Implements proper dependency management in effects
- Conditional rendering based on component readiness

## Common Issues
- **Missing Functions**: Ensure context hook provides required functions
- **State Synchronization**: Verify both components report ready state
- **Flow Interruption**: Check error handling doesn't break submission chain

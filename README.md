## The Playbook Structure

### **Concept**
*   [**The GenAI Enablement Playbook: Concept**](./00-concept.md)
    *   This document defines the conceptual foundation for developing the playbook. It explains the core ideas that guide the playbook's structure and content.

---

## The Four Chapters

### **1. The Problem**
*   [Simple prompt-driven development fails on large-scale projects](./01-the-problem.md)
    *   The limitations of simple prompting, the shift to delegation, prerequisites for effective AI use, and the documentation challenge.

### **2. The Principle**
*   [AI amplifies existing processes](./02-the-principle.md)
    *   The strategic question, self-reinforcing cycle, golden mean for tool selection, spec-driven development, skeleton-first approach, and general rules for AI-agent.

### **3. The Solution**
*   [Documentation preparation in three concentric circles of constraints](./03-the-solution.md)
    *   Basic architectural, system configuration, and task-specific documentation, with techniques for creating and managing context (architectural slicing, structured decomposition).

### **4. The Result**
*   [Effective development and evolved developers](./04-the-result.md)
    *   Developers who direct AI-assisted work with architectural thinking and disciplined workflows.

## How to Use This Playbook

This playbook follows a logical progression from problem identification through principle understanding to solution implementation and expected results. Each chapter builds on previous concepts, creating a coherent system for enabling GenAI on projects.

Read the chapters sequentially to understand the complete approach, or reference specific chapters for particular concepts.

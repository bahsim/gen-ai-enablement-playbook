title: "Spec: Architectural Slice Discovery"
description: To perform a formal discovery and definition of the primary, evidence-based "architectural slices" (cross-cutting concerns) present in the `checkout-js` codebase.
objective: To generate a foundational "Level 2" document that identifies, lists, and provides a high-level architectural description for each major slice. This document must be derived solely from direct analysis of the codebase, not from prior assumptions, and will serve as the evidentiary basis for all subsequent architectural classification.

### 1. Architectural Principles

*   **Principle of Evidentiary Basis:** Every slice defined in this document must be directly traceable to a concrete implementation pattern in the `checkout-js` codebase. This is a discovery document, not a design document.
*   **Principle of High-Level Abstraction:** The descriptions for each slice must remain at a high level, focusing on the system's "what" and "why" (its architectural role and responsibility). Deep implementation details ("how") belong in future, dedicated "Level 3" guides.

### 2. Rationale

Before we can classify the system's architecture into "domains," we must first perform the rigorous work of discovering what architectural components actually exist. A simple, unproven list is architectural fiction. This document establishes the factual, evidence-based foundation of all cross-cutting concerns. It answers the fundamental question: "What are the actual, verifiable architectural building blocks of this system?"

### 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the `03-architectural-slices.md` file being populated with the following sections:

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   Must state that the document's purpose is to formally identify and define the primary architectural slices discovered through codebase analysis.
    *   Must establish that this list is the foundational evidence for subsequent architectural documentation.

2.  **The Discovered Architectural Slices:**
    *   Must contain a list of all major slices found in the codebase.
    *   Each item in the list must include:
        *   **The Slice Name:** (e.g., `State Management Slice`).
        *   **Architectural Responsibility:** A concise, one-sentence description of the slice's purpose.
        *   **Primary Code Evidence:** A list of the key file(s) or component(s) that serve as the concrete implementation of this slice (e.g., `CheckoutPage.tsx`, `withCheckout HOC`).

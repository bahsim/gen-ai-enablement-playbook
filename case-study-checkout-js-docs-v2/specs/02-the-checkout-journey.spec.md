title: 'Spec: The Core Checkout Journeys'
description: To define the structure and content for the document that describes the primary user flows and their major conditional branches.
objective: To generate a clear, narrative document that details the core checkout journeys and their major branches, providing essential context for the application's orchestration logic.
---

### 1. Architectural Principles

The documentation for the Checkout Journey **must** be framed by the following core principles:

*   **Principle of Narrative Context:** This document's primary purpose is to provide the narrative "why" for the orchestration flow shown in the `01-principal-architectural-schema.md`. It translates the static floor plan into a dynamic story of user progression.
*   **Principle of Mapping Core Journeys:** The document must focus on the primary, successful user journeys and the major, architecturally significant conditional branches that direct the flow. Minor edge cases and error states are out of scope.

### 2. Rationale

Before a developer can understand the implementation details of any single "room" (feature module) or "wiring" (shared system), they must first understand the application's primary conditional flows. This document provides that foundational narrative, making the entire system easier to reason about.

### 3. Verification Criteria

The successful execution of this spec will result in the `02-the-checkout-journey.md` file being populated with the following sections:

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   Must define the "Core Checkout Journeys" as the primary paths and branches a user follows to complete a purchase.
    *   Must state that this document provides the narrative context for the `01-principal-architectural-schema.md`.

2.  **The Core Checkout Journeys & Their Major Branches:**
    *   Must include sections that detail each major conditional branch of the journey.
    *   Must cover the following branches: Guest vs. Registered User, Physical vs. Digital Goods, Billing Address logic, and Multi-Shipping mode.

3.  **Combined Journey State Diagram:**
    *   Must include a Mermaid `graph` diagram (flowchart) that visually represents the core flows and their branches.
    *   The diagram must clearly show the user progressing through the major steps (Customer, Shipping, Billing, Payment) and culminating in the Order Confirmation.
    *   The diagram must visualize all major conditional logic, including the ability for a user to log in from intermediate steps.

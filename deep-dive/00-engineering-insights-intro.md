# Engineering Insights

This section contains deep-dive articles that explore foundational concepts and strategic approaches in AI-assisted engineering. These are not purely practical guides—they are more abstract, conceptual explorations that help us understand the bigger picture.

## Why These Insights Matter

Practical examples and step-by-step approaches are essential for day-to-day work. They provide immediate, actionable guidance that helps us solve specific problems efficiently. However, sometimes we must step back and see the whole picture—to understand the underlying principles, the strategic thinking, and the fundamental shifts that shape our practice.

**Sometimes we don't see the forest for the trees.** When we're focused on immediate implementation details, we can miss the broader patterns, the strategic decisions, and the foundational concepts that guide effective engineering practice. These insights help us understand not just *how* to do something, but *why* we approach it a certain way, and *when* different strategies are most effective.

## What You'll Find Here

These articles explore:
- **Foundational principles** that guide engineering decisions
- **Strategic frameworks** for approaching complex problems
- **Conceptual shifts** that change how we think about our work
- **Decision frameworks** that help us choose the right approach
- **The bigger picture** behind practical techniques

These insights complement practical guides by providing the conceptual foundation that makes those guides more effective. They help us understand the reasoning behind best practices, recognize when to apply different approaches, and make informed decisions when facing new challenges.

## Articles

- [The Golden Mean: Strategic Tool Selection](./01-golden-mean/01-golden-mean.md) - A deep-dive into choosing the right tool for each task: manual labor, automation by scripts, or AI generation.

- [The Skeleton-First Approach](./02-skeleton-first-approach/02-skeleton-first-approach.md) - A deep-dive into creating structure before implementation—how skeleton-first reduces cognitive load and improves AI collaboration.

## How to Use These Insights

These articles are designed for:
- **Understanding the "why"** behind engineering practices
- **Developing strategic thinking** about tool selection and workflow design
- **Recognizing patterns** that apply across different contexts
- **Making informed decisions** when facing novel situations
- **Building a deeper understanding** of AI-assisted engineering principles

Read these when you want to understand the foundational concepts that guide effective practice, not just the immediate steps to solve a specific problem.
